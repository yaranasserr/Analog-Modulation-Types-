# Analog-Modulation-Types-
In this project, I implemented various analog modulation techniques, namely Double-Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSBTC), Double-Sideband with Suppressed Carrier (DBSSC), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Single Sideband (SSB) on a sound track using MATLAB. I incorporated the addition of noise to simulate real-world transmission conditions. The modulated signals were transmitted and subsequently received to analyze the effects of noise on the audio quality. This project aimed to demonstrate the practical implementation and evaluation of analog modulation techniques in a simulated transmission scenario using MATLAB.
